description: Report back in chat at the end of a task, in the short or the full form. Use at the end of every task.

# Report back

1. Choose the form. Full: this session changed a file, opened or updated a
   pull request or issue, or needs a decision. Otherwise short. Posting a
   comment gets the short form.
2. Fill every section; a section that does not apply says `None`. Give the
   verdict once, at the top.
3. Report actual output, not expected output. Say what was not run, and why.
4. List each decision you made that was the maintainer's.

## Short form

```text
<Answer in one or two sentences.>
Based on: <files read or commands run; "memory only" if nothing was checked>
Open: <anything unverified, or None>
```

## Full form

```text
## <title>
**Verdict: COMPLETE | NOT COMPLETE — <one line; anything remaining goes here>**
**End product:** <code change | design | issue #n | PR #n | decision for you> — <path or link>

1 What changed — files as path:line, or the issue or PR created
2 Checks run — command → result; anything not run → why
3 Decisions I made that were yours — choice, rejected alternative, cost to reverse
4 What I need from you — Action Needed / Decision Needed, blocking items first; or None
5 Close-out — what to review, branch state, what to keep
```
