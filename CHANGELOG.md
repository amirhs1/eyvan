# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial release of the Eyvan template: a minimalist, accessibility-first
  Jekyll portfolio and writing template for GitHub Pages, with an ITCSS/BEM
  Sass architecture, reusable long-form content includes (figures, video,
  audio, tables, cross-references), light/dark theming, and a GitHub Actions
  build-and-deploy pipeline gated by a Playwright + axe accessibility suite.
- Dependabot configuration for Bundler, npm, and GitHub Actions, so dependency
  and security updates surface automatically as pull requests.
- `.ruby-version`, with both CI workflows reading the Ruby version from it
  instead of duplicating the version number inline.
- Optional `width` / `height` support on `figure.html` (single- and
  multi-image), letting the browser reserve layout space for images before
  they load and preventing cumulative layout shift; applied to the figures in
  the existing example posts using their real measured pixel dimensions.
- An accessibility test covering a code-heavy page in both light and dark
  themes.
- `SECURITY.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- This changelog.

### Fixed

- Insufficient color contrast on syntax-highlighted strings and numbers in the
  light theme, and on variables in the dark theme — found by the new
  code-heavy-page accessibility test (WCAG 2.1 AA, `color-contrast`). New
  `$clr-p-green-dark` / `$clr-p-orange-dark` / `$clr-p-red-light` palette
  variants replace the previous tokens in those specific Base16 slots only;
  the brand palette and UI semantic colors (links, buttons, state colors) are
  unchanged.
- Non-unique accessible names on overflowing code blocks — when a page had
  more than one, `code-block-a11y.js` gave each a literal `aria-label="Code
  sample"`, which axe flags as indistinguishable landmarks (`landmark-unique`).
  Each region now gets a numbered label (`Code sample 1`, `Code sample 2`, …).
